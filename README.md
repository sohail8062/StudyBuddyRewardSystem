# STUDY BUDDY REWARD SYSTEM

## Project Description

The Study Buddy Reward System is a blockchain-based application designed to incentivize and gamify the learning process for students. By leveraging smart contract technology, this system provides a transparent, tamper-proof way to track study sessions and reward consistent learning habits with digital tokens.

Students earn "StudyCoins" for completing verified study sessions, which can then be redeemed for real-world rewards such as extra screen time, special treats, or family privileges. This creates a positive feedback loop that encourages regular study habits while making learning more engaging and rewarding.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize education by making studying as engaging as gaming. We believe that by combining blockchain technology with educational incentives, we can:

- **Transform Learning Habits**: Convert studying from a chore into an exciting, rewarding activity
- **Build Transparency**: Provide parents and teachers with verifiable proof of study efforts
- **Create Motivation**: Establish a clear reward system that encourages consistent learning
- **Foster Independence**: Allow students to take ownership of their educational journey
- **Bridge Digital Divide**: Introduce students to blockchain technology in a practical, educational context
